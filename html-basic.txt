1) What is html?
    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
    HTML describes the structure of a Web page
    HTML consists of a series of elements
    HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
    HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

2) HTML Elements
     The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
     <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

      Examples:
      <h1>My First Heading</h1>
      <p>My first paragraph.</p>

Inline elements:
    Inline elements display in a line.
    They do not force the text after them to a new line.
    An anchor (or link) is an example of an inline element. 
    You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a line.

    Examples of inline elements:
      <a>
      <strong>
      <em> 
      <b>
      <i>
      <span>

  Block elements
     Block level elements take up as much space as possible by default. 
     Each block level element will start a new line on the page, stacking down the page. 
     In addition to stacking vertically, block level elements will also take up as much horizontal space as possible.

     The p element is an example of a block level element. Each new paragraph tag will appear on its own line vertically. 
     Paragraphs with longer content will stretch all the way to the edge of the page.
     Examples of block level elements:
       <p>
       <ol>
       <ul>

5) list out some tags

    <!DOCTYPE> 	Defines the document type
    <head>	          Contains metadata/information for the document
    <title>	          Defines a title for the document
    <body>	          Defines the document's body
    <h1> to <h6>	Defines HTML headings
    <ol>	          Defines an ordered list
    <ul>	          Defines an Unordered list
    <p>	                    Defines a paragraph
    <strong>	          Defines important text
    <style>	          Defines style information for a document
    <br>	          Defines a single line break
    <button>	          Defines a clickable button

3) HTML Attributes
      HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
      All HTML elements can have attributes
      Attributes provide additional information about elements
      Attributes are always specified in the start tag
      Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

4)  Basic structure of html file
        An HTML document is composed of three parts: 
          a line containing HTML version information, 
          a declarative header section (delimited by the HEAD element), 
          a body, which contains the document's actual content.
